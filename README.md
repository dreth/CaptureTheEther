# Capture the Ether solutions

This repo contains my solutions and methodology to solve the [Capture the Ether CTF](https://capturetheether.com/). I solved the challenges locally using brownie. Then did it on chain on brownie on the rinkeby test network through the Infura API. To fork rinkeby I also used the Infura API, though not always successfully.

## My local environment setup

1. Install relevant libraries

```
pip install eth-brownie rlp eth-account eth-utils hexbytes ecdsa
```
