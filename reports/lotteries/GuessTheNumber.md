# Guess the number

## Objectives

Iâ€™m thinking of a number. All you have to do is guess it.

## Solution

The solution is in the state variable `answer`, which is 42. All we have to do is call `guess()` passing 42 and with a value of 1 ether. This will return the entire balance of the contract, which is 1 ether on deployment as per the constructor + 1 ether that we send to be able to call `guess()`.
